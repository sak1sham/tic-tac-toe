# Executable file of Tic-Tac-Toe

Download it. Browser may give you unsafe warning, accept it and continue. This exe file is completely safe.

NOTE: If you want the source code, then I am sorry to say that you may only find it in the deleted files in google datacenter. I uploaded it there and forgot about it. Later I found that it was missing along with some other files. Or you can even reverse engineer it. If you can retrieve the source code from this exe file, then please ping me too.
